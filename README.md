# Some Observations - 

1. We Ran Bubble sort with array size of nearly 700000 and merge sort with same number and found that the time it takes for *bubble sort is 15 minutes* and *merge sort was instantaneous*. The only limitation with the merge sort was memory sortage or we would have tried even larger number.
We have put the codes as _stressTest file names , You can try for your selves also.
